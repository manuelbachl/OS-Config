## Aliases
To activate the aliases and functions in this package, copy the file `aliases.sh` and the directory `aliases-definitions` to your home directory (e.g. `~/` or `/home/username/`).
After that, you need to add the following line to the end of your `~/.zshrc` or `~/.bashrc`:

`source $HOME/aliases.sh`
