# OS-Config

## Aliases
To activate the aliases and functions in this package, copy the file `aliases.sh` and the directory `aliases-definitions` to your desired destination.
After that, you need to add the following line to the end of your `~/.zshrc` or `~/.bashrc`:

`source <path/to/your>/aliases.sh`

_Note: The part between `<` and `>` is user-related, you need to adjust them to fit to your needs._
